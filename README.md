# MieterUnity - Smart Platform for Tenant Communication

## This project is the final capstone project that we, as a two-person team, are designing, developing, and deploying as part of a bootcamp at WBS. It is currently only a test version.

## üöÄ Elevator Pitch

MieterUnity is the smart platform that brings tenants together for seamless communication and organization. Forget chaotic WhatsApp groups and endless email chains! With MieterUnity, tenants can connect, discuss important topics, organize collective actions, and strengthen their voice towards landlords‚Äîall in a secure and anonymous environment.

## üåü Features (MVP - Minimum Viable Product)

- Secure authentication via email and password.

### 2. Discussion Platform

- Central discussion area (like a forum or feed) for tenant conversations.
- Threads categorized by topics such as "Technical Issues," "House Rules," and "General Discussions."

### 3. Organized Actions

- Create and coordinate tenant-driven initiatives (e.g., petitions, complaint letters).
- Proposals can be submitted and voted on.

### 4. Notifications

- Push notifications or emails for important discussions and new actions.

### 5. Privacy & Security
